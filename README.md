### Overview

<div align="left">
React Web Application project's goal is to design and develop a "React" learning portal using HTML, CSS, JS and React. This project encourages the use of components to make the build dynamic and easy to modify. Configuration of new pages will simply require creating a new component and adding it to the original App.js file. There are few new features added to this project compared to the previous web application project using only JavaScript. This project has search features using fuse.js - it is a fuzzy search method which helps to search for text that matches a term closely instead of exactly. It also has Material UI library for building the Menu/Submenu components as well as Material Icons.
