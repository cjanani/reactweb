    This React tutorial will help beginners understand React concepts and how to implement them to build a performant React application.

    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
    
    To follow this course, we expect you to be familiar with the following topics:
    <ul>
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript fundamentals like the object, arrays, conditionals, and so on</li>
    <li>JavaScript ES6 features like the arrow functions, object destructuring, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What is React?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
          React (sometimes called React js) is a JavaScript library that originated at Facebook for building interactive user interfaces or UIs. It lets developers create sizeable web apps or complex UIs by integrating a small, isolated code snippet.
        </li>
        <li>
          
          It’s used for building interactive user interfaces and web
          applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than
          you would with vanilla JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable
          components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks.
        </li>
        <li>
          These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which,
          when assembled, form the application’s entire user interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          React’s primary role in an application is to handle the view layer of
          that application just like the V in a model-view-controller (MVC)
          pattern by providing the best and most efficient rendering execution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rather than dealing with the whole user interface as a single unit,
          React.js encourages developers to separate these complex UIs into
          individual reusable components that form the building blocks of the
          whole UI.
        </li>
        <li>
          In doing so, the ReactJS framework combines the speed and efficiency
          of JavaScript with a more efficient method of manipulating the DOM to
          render web pages faster and create highly dynamic and responsive web
          applications.
        </li>
      </ul>
